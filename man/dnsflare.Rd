\title{Query 'Cloudflare' Domain Name System ('DNS') Servers over 'HTTPS'}
\description{
Domain Name System ('DNS') queries are generally perfomed by operating
system calls when browsing the internet or making other network connectios. DNS
over 'HTTPS' services offer more local confidentiality and some 'DNS' providers
like Cloudflare offer (\url{https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/dns-over-https/json-format/})
an 'API'-like service along with other privacy-enabled 'DNS' offerings. Tools are
provided to query this 'DNS' 'API'.
}
\details{
\code{1.1.1.1} is a privacy centric resolver so it does not send any client IP
information and does not send the EDNS Client Subnet Header to authoritative
servers.

For decreased latency, reduced privacy leakage of queries and lower load on
the DNS system, \code{1.1.1.1} upstreams to locally hosted root zone files.

Cloudflare minimizes privacy leakage by only sending minimal query name to
authoritative DNS servers. For example, if a client is looking for
\code{foo.bar.example.com}, the only part of the query \code{1.1.1.1} discloses to \code{.com}
is that we want to know whoâ€™s responsible for \code{example.com} and the zone
internals stay hidden.
}
\examples{
# Queries
query("r-project.org", "A")
query("r-project.org", "MX")

# What IPs does CF use when it queries?
cf_upstream_ipv4()
cf_upstream_ipv6()
