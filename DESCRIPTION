Description: Domain Name System ('DNS') queries are generally perfomed by operating
    system calls when browsing the internet or making other network connectios. DNS
    over 'HTTPS' services offer more local confidentiality and some 'DNS' providers
    like Cloudflare offer (<https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/dns-over-https/json-format/>)
    an 'API'-like service along with other privacy-enabled 'DNS' offerings. Tools are
    provided to query this 'DNS' 'API'.
